			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Added a set of <![CDATA[&lt;mime-mapping&gt;]]> that we previously had installed to various projects.
						These have an emphasis on serving content as <code>UTF-8</code>, including CSS, JavaScript, HTML, XML, â€¦
					</p>
					<p>
						Projects that rely on these mappings, such as
						<ao:a href="https://aoindustries.com/ao-servlet-last-modified/">AO Servlet Last Modified</ao:a>,
						simply add this as a Maven dependency.
					</p>
